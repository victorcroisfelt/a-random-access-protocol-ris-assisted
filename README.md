- [x] **Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces: Physics, Propagation, and Pathloss Modeling (2020)** [[pdf]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8936989) [[code]](https://github.com/emilbjornson/IRS-modeling)
> Proposes a simple pathloss model for a RIS-assited communication link based on the properties of the scattered wave after reflection on a metal plate. RIS' reflection coefficients are computed based on the Generalized Snell's law.

-[x] **Power Scaling Laws and Near-Field Behaviors of Massive MIMO and Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (2020)** [[pdf]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9184098) [[code]](https://github.com/emilbjornson/near-field-behavior)
> The authors first derive an upper bound for the pathloss of a source communicating with a planar array, consdering the three near-field properties: 1) varying distances to the antennas, 2) polarizations mismatches, and effective areas. With this the authors evaluate asymptotic behaviors. Main result: despite N^2 RIS antenna gain, one of the Ns represent a drawback.
